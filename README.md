# Network Algorithm Simulations

A Python-based collection of classic computer network algorithms and coding theory demonstrations. Each experiment is self-contained and designed for academic, demonstration, and learning purposes.

## Included Experiments

- `crc_simulation.py`  
  Simulates Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for error detection in communication frames. Allows users to input data bits and a generator polynomial, computes CRC, and detects errors in transmission.

- `hamming_code.py`  
  Implements Hamming Code for error detection and correction. Allows encoding of data bits, simulation of bit errors, and automatic detection/correction of single-bit errors.

- `distance_vector.py`  
  Simulates Distance Vector Routing algorithm. Demonstrates network routers periodically updating routing tables based on neighbors until convergence.

- `link_state_routing.py`  
  Simulates Link State Routing using Dijkstra’s algorithm. Computes shortest path routing tables for all routers based on the network topology.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x (no additional libraries needed)

### Running an Experiment

Each file (e.g., `crc_simulation.py`) is runnable as a standalone script.  
Open terminal and run:
```bash
python crc_simulation.py
```

Follow interactive prompts in the terminal for inputs.

## Usage

- Educational demos for computer networks courses
- Coding reference for error control and routing algorithms
- Experimentation and learning for students and hobbyists

## Repository Structure

- Each script contains all logic and user interaction in one file.
- No external dependencies required.
